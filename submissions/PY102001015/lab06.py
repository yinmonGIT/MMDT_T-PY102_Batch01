# Q1 — schedule_next_job
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# priority score (smaller value = higher priority).
#
# The system must always be able to quickly access (O(1)) the job
# with the highest priority (smallest score).
#
# You are given the current job list (arr) and a new job
# (priority_score).
#
# Write a function to add a new job into the system
# and and reorganize the list so that the priority rule is maintained.

# IMPORTANT:
# - You may use the provided helper functions to adjust the structure.
# - Do NOT implement any additional helper functions.

# After removal, reorganize the list to maintain the
# priority rule.

# Q3 — personal priority reflection
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This question is about reflecting on your personal priorities.
#
# You are given a structure where each item is:
#     (weight, category)
#
# Smaller weight = higher priority.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Change the weights (numbers) based on YOUR priorities.
# 2. Do NOT change the category names.
# 3. Insert a new category ("security") with your chosen weight.
# 4. Maintain the structure using the provided helper function.
#
# NOTE:
# - There is NO single correct answer.
# - Focus on meaningful weights based on your perspective.
# - Do NOT create additional helper functions.
